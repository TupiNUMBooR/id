## About me

Hi! I'm a Senior Software Developer who likes **backend** and **DevOps**.
I enjoy working where machines talk to machines.
I like creating things and solving hard problems.
Often become the go-to person in teams - the one others trust to figure things out.
Right now I mostly work with Java + Spring Boot + Docker.
